## Introduction

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on ‚Äì an American Sign Language (ASL) Detection system using YOLOv5! üöÄ While I may not be well-versed in ASL, this project is designed to help bridge communication gaps for those who rely on ASL for their daily interactions.

### What is ASL Detection?

ASL is a beautiful and expressive language used by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities worldwide. This project aims to bridge communication gaps by detecting and translating ASL signs into text, making communication more accessible and inclusive.

## Key Features

üîç **Detection of ASL Signs**: Our system can detect 18 essential ASL signs, including words and phrases such as "I," "apple," "can," "good," "have," "help," "how," "like," "love," "my," "no," "sorry," "thank you," "want," "yes," "you," and "your."

üì¶ **YOLOv5 Implementation**: We've integrated the popular YOLOv5 object detection model, known for its speed and accuracy, to recognize ASL signs in real-time.

üì∏ **Webcam Integration**: This project can be used with a standard webcam, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ASL Detection system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the ASL Detection system:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

4. Point your webcam at ASL signs, and watch the magic happen!

## Usage

Once you've launched the ASL Detection system, you can start using it with your webcam. Point the webcam towards ASL signs, and the system will detect and display the corresponding text on the screen in real-time.

## Why It Matters

ASL is a vital form of communication for millions of people. By automating the detection of ASL signs, we can empower individuals with limited or no hearing to participate fully in conversations, access information, and connect with others. This project strives to make a positive impact on the lives of those who rely on ASL as their primary means of communication.
